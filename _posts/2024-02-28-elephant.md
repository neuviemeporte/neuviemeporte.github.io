<small>(_This post is part of a [series]({% link category/f15-se2.html %}) on the subject of my hobby project, which is recreating the C source code for the 1989 game [F-15 Strike Eagle II]({% post_url 2022-06-05-origins %}) by reverse engineering the original binaries._)</small>

Yeah, I know, I kind of suggested (if not exactly promised) in the last post that I would let go of fiddling with the tooling and get back into reconstrucing the source code for the game. But let's stop kidding ourselves; there's an elephant in the room that we need to talk about.

![](/images/elephant.webp){: .center-image-narrow }

The pre-release source code for Microprose's 1994 Fleet Defender got [leaked](https://archive.org/details/f-14-src) apparently as far back as the 90s, being passed around on BBSes. I felt kind of silly when I heard about it a few years into my F15SE2 project because I was completely unaware of it. Could it be that I had (most) of the source code available from the very beginning and just didn't know? That would be pretty embarassing. At least I did not go into the main flight game engine in `EGAME.EXE` yet, and if I could match the leaked source code to the game binary routines, it could shave **years** off my reversing efforts.

As far as I understand it, based on superficial similarities and information from ex-Microprose employees that were kind enough to talk to me, the late-80s-to-early-90s Microprose MS-DOS flight sim codebase was evolving and being shared between projects as new games were being developed. The origins of this codebase are somewhat murky, but Sid Meier gives some hints in his [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50489373-sid-meier-s-memoir):

> (...) just a few months after _Red Storm Rising_ hit shelves, I took the opportunity to return to the flight simulator genre with a game called _F-19 Stealth Fighter_. It was a half upgrade, half sequel to an existing game called _Project Stealth Fighter_, with the major distinction being that this version would be developed on the IBM personal computer. A few older games had been directly ported up to the new system, but they didn't take advantage of the new technology; they just looked like C64 games running on a bigger machine. (...) I was intrigued by the chance to explore this topic with an entirely new code base (...)

That makes it sound like _F-19_ was largely developed from scratch even though it's possible they picked some bits from their earlier DOS titles. The timeline of this codebase would therefore go something like this:

1. F-19 Stealth Fighter (1988)
2. F-15 Strike Eagle 2 (original 1989, expansion 1991) 
3. F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0 (1991)
4. F-15 Strike Eagle III (1992)
5. Fleet Defender (1994)

There have been a bunch of MPS games released in between these dates, including some flight simulators. So, does that mean that parts of that common code are in _Knights of the Sky_ (1990), _Gunship 2000_ (1991), _B-17 Flying Fortress_ (1992) or even _M1 Tank Platoon_ (1989)? I don't know, probably yes. I'm pretty sure parts of the video display code, sprite and overlay handling are shared even with non-sims like _Civilization_ (1991). I especially don't know what happened to the code between _F-117_ and _F-15 III_ because they look radically different and I'm not sure if there was an intermediate step, or did _F-15 III_ just take the _F-117_ code and improved on it heavily. It's also a big unknown how the ports were handled; _F-19_ was on both the Amiga and Atari ST, _F-15 II_ was additionally ported to the Sega Genesis, _F-117_ was likewise on the Amiga, and it was only with _F-15 III_ that MPS started targeting DOS exclusively with this codebase. I wonder if any of the code written for the PC ended up in any of the ports. There were C compilers available for the Amiga like Aztec C and Lattice C, but I think the emitted code would be too inefficient for the needs of game development, and I expect that the whole thing was rewritten in assembly for any ports MPS might have done, but I could be wrong.

Bottom line, there's at least 3 product generations between _F-15 II_ and _Fleet Defender_. That makes it unlikely for them to be largely identical, but surely some routines for flight dynamics and/or 3D projection could have remained (mostly) unchanged? The possibility that the answers to F15SE2's most difficult riddles might lay in the Fleet Defender code repository is something that I could not resist, so I downloaded it and started looking around.

There are of course ethical/legal questions involved. The source code was not officially released and is therefore for all intents and purposes, stolen. I thought long and hard about whether or not I should look at it at all, because I don't want to compromise my project, but I finally decided that the opportunity was too great to miss. However, I decided I would under no circumstances lift any part of the code from the leaked repository into my own project. My usage of the leaked code will be limited to studying and potentially applying the conclusions to my project -- if there are any to apply. The leak was of a pre-release version and the source code is incomplete (more on that below), so any harm to the sales of _Fleet Defender_ would be negligible, and it's more that 30 years in the past. These days, the leaked source code is an artifact of historical research. I think of it something like one of the works of ancient art in Berlin's [Neues Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum). Next to many of these items you will find notes euphemistically saying "Acquired in 1935" or "Found in Greece in 1918", which means they were picked up for peanuts or just straight up stolen from other countries and brought over to Germany back when hardly anybody cared about those treasures, or realized they could become valuable. Their return is a contentious matter that's still under discussion. There's also an argument to be made that if the Germans hadn't taken and preserved the items, they would probably have been lost to neglect or chopped up to make road gravel. But does that mean that we can't or shouldn't admire them in the meantime? No, that would be an even greater waste, so I'm not going to pretend like this gem of early 3D gaming technology doesn't exist, either.

With that out of the way, let's see what we can learn from that source code. There are 79 C files, 27 header files and 17 ASM files, and the whole source repository weighs in around 4MB. The sources are about half of that, with the rest being what looks like various campaign scenario files, damage tables and aircraft stats, both in readable formats and compiled into binary equivalents, with some of the compiler tooling included in the repository. Those might be useful for modding and/or creating new missions. Several files contain C code while having odd extensions like `.bk1/.ori/.mik` -- these seem backup/work copies of equivalent `.c` files for tweaking.

## A look at the code

Here are some interesting takeouts from the _Fleet Defender_ source code:

/*----------*/
{% endhighlight %}

Most of the files in the repository are dated 1990-1994, with the oldest ones (containing trig function value tables) from 1989, but this appears to be the oldest date mentioned in the codebase, and the comment seems to indicate the Fleet Defender dev seemed appropriately impressed. The comment appears to confirm that the F-19 codebase has been reused in multiple projects over its lifetime, and parts of it made it into _F-15 III_ and _Fleet Defender_. The references to "F-15 (III)" are the most numerous in the codebase, with a few stray ocurrences of "F-19/Stealth Fighter", but surprisingly nothing about "F-117". The file itself contains just 5 short routines seemingly related to 3D views (or not?).

Again, it looks like the _F-15 III_ radar ([APG-70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/APG-63_radar_family)) code was tweaked and reused for [AWG-9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/AWG-9) radar in Fleet Defender. I don't expect to find this in _F-15 II_ though, whose radar is extremely simplistic and arcade-like.

This contains the main function of the game and the main game loop itself. What's interesting is that it was apparently adapted from _F-15_, and the fact that Sid is mentioned (who did not work on _F-15 III_) makes me think this was all the way from _F-15 II_. It's not that big a deal because the function is rather simple, just calls into other functions and would be modified for _Fleet Defender_ anyway, but it's nevertheless cool to look at, and the routine names, structure definitions and other references might be useful. It's iteresting to see it init and load the `mgraphic.exe` video overlay driver, and I also remember setting the `M` mode value for VGA graphics in my code. The source code contains the name of Vaughn Thomas who was a tester at MPS during that time, but I don't think that means he was the source of the leak - some developer probably created this build for Vaughn, gave the binaries to him for testing, and the source code was pilfered sometime at that point. 

You can also see the ancient origins of the codebase in the fact that many routines are written in the pre-ANSI K&R style of C, with no return type (which defaulted to `int`), and local variables defined before the opening brace.

This comment is present in `flight2.c` and in `views.c`, although the latter with a later date of 1993. Both are caculation-dense routines seemingly for calculating flight dynamics and 3D view processing, and the fact that it seems they originated from _F-19_ makes me hope I can find traces of this code in _F-15 II_ which would be super helpful.

Likewise, these two files credited to Sid and seemingly originating from _F-19_ seem like they might carry over to _F-15 II_. `planes.c` is over 6000 lines long! The radar handling logic looks to cover both SAMs and air-to-air, and I think it could be more useful than the advanced AWG-9 stuff.

{% endhighlight %}

I'm not sure if this means that the entire game is capped at 15 FPS, or is it just the stealth handling code running at that speed. Probably it's the latter, but as I remember it, _Fleet Defender_ isn't very smooth even on fast machines.

Finally, some fun finds:

// THIS SUCKS!!! THIS WAS NOT MY IDEA - I REALIZE THAT THIS TAKES UP TO MUCH

{% endhighlight %}

The former comment applies to a global symbol used to execute `longjmp()` in `awg9.c`, the latter to some statically initialized arrays in `riohead.c`. Looks like developer frustration is a given on pretty much any software project. 😉

## Great, now what?

Now, how do we go about figuring out if any of this code is actually present in _F15 II_, and if so, where? Fortunately, I [recently developed]({% post_url 2025-01-30-newtooling2 %}) some tooling for extracting routine signatures from binaries and locating them in other binaries, which I orignally used to see if any work I did for _F-15 II_'s `START.EXE` would carry over to `EGAME.EXE`. This time, I will use it to search for bits of `F14.EXE` in `EGAME.EXE`. I am a bit lucky here. Despite _Fleet Defender_'s relatively late release date of 1994, the game does not appear to use protected mode, or much 32-bit code either (except for a few minor sections in assembly files, still in real mode). It's kind of surprising given that by that was the year _Doom II_ came out, but for better or worse, _Fleet Defender_ seems to run 16bit real mode code. If it had been rewritten to use protected mode, the code would likely be mostly useless to me.

The first thing I need to do then is build the code. There is a DOS-era makefile included in the source tree, but I ended up making my own to have a bit more control over the build process and integrate well with my tooling for wrapping MS C. Incidentally, _Fleet Defender_ seems to have been compiled by MSC 7.0, but I need to build it with MSC 5.1 to have the code matching _F-15 II_ as closely as possible. For that, I had to do a couple tweaks to the code, mostly with large, statically initalized arrays defined within functions that MSC 5.1 did not like, but it was a simple matter of moving them up to global scope. I also had to exclude some C files which used inline assembly which is not supported in MSC 5.1, but there were only a few and they contained a minuscule amount of code.

Unfortunately, my tooling cannot (yet) parse object files in the OMF format, only EXEs, so I also need to link it into an executable. Here we come to an unfortunate realization: the code is incomplete. Most of the missing functions are declared in the header `library.h`:

This looks quite familiar. I am pretty convinced that the "user/resident" declarations correspond to a bunch of common utility routines that I found while reconstructing F15SE2's `START.EXE`, while the "Graphic/MISC/SOUND" prototypes are functions from the runtime-loaded [overlay drivers]({% post_url 2023-07-12-overlays %}), calls to which I can see all over the place in F15SE2. This library header file is a boon in itself, as I still haven't figured out the arguments and/or the purpose of many of those functions. Establishing the relationship between the declarations and the routines in the code will not be straightforward, since the header file seems to have the graphics routines (which are the most numerous and important) listed in alphabetical order, but I'm sure I can figure it out eventually.

It actually makes sense for the library code to be missing; it was probably part of a different source tree, shared between multiple game projects at MPS, and one that the _Fleet Defender_ devs did not need to mess with (most of the time?). For my needs, I just stubbed all of them out and moved on. This still left me with a bunch of unresolved symbols for some routines and data from the linker. I don't know what these are and what happened to them, but they are also missing from the source code, so it's stub time again:

{% highlight cpp %}

That, along with the library function stubs got rid of the unresolved symbols. But the linker failed with a "fixup overflow" error in the data segment, meaning the size of the data exceeded 64k, and I'm building the code with the medium memory model (`/AM`), so there's just one data segment. I was probably overly greedy in trying to cram as many of the source files into the exe as possible, and I could remove some, but I actually ended up using the `/NOD[EFAULTLIB]` linker option to avoid linking in the standard C library and its associated data, because I don't actually need the resulting executable to be runnable. Doing that, however meant that I also had to stub out a bunch of libc routines to get it to link, but finally link it did, and I had my coveted `f14.exe`, built with MSC 5.1 with default flags.

The fact that the executable doesn't run or have libc, poses a different problem. Because there's no `START` from crt0, the entrypoint for the exectuable is fixed at `0:0`. I need to walk the code with my `mzmap` tool to figure out where the routines begin and end, so I can extract their signatures for comparison with F15SE2, but if the main entrypoint is broken and control doesn't really go anywhere, the walker will fail.

However, I *do* know where the routines are located, because the linker output a `.MAP` file when it created `f14.exe`, and the map file lists all public routines along with their entrypoint addresses. I implemented a new option to `mzmap`; `--linkmap` lets it ingest the linker map file as a set of "hints" for routine entrypoints, segment locations and data references as well. That adds a useful feature to `mzmap`, and while walking `f14.exe`, I found and fixed a bunch of pretty serious bugs in the walker, so I'm pretty happy that I took the effort to do so. At the end, I had a map file compatible with my tooling, with most of the `f14.exe` routine boundaries discovered.

Okay, now with the F-14 executable built and the map generated, time to extract the signatures. Or is it? My `mzdup` tool scans for duplicate routines given two exes and their maps. But I want it to be more flexible, so I ended splitting up the job, implementing `mzsig`. Given an exe and its map, plus some options to say what size of routines it should ignore, it will extract the signatures and save them to a file. This also lets me combine signatures from more than one executable in one signature file, which is pretty handy -- remember that some F15SE2 routines have been built [with debug flags enabled]({% post_url 2023-09-02-compiler3 %}), so I need to build and extract signatures for at least two versions of `f14.exe`, one with `/Zi` and one without it. 

The new version of `mzdup` ingests the signature file along with a exe/mapfile pair to look for matches in. I also changed the edit distance cutoff threshold from a hard value shared between all routines to a configurable ratio of the routine size, meaning bigger routines can have more differing instructions than smaller ones and still be considered matches.

## Give us the damn results already

Well, okay, since you ask so nicely:

It was able to find matches for 20 unique routines from `f14.exe` built with default flags, which constitutes a meager 3% of F15SE2's `egame.exe`. I tried with a version built with `/Zi` and it was similar. Increasing the maximum acceptable edit distance ratio does not seem to help much.

## Great, so all that for nothing?

Depends on how you look at it. For me, it's really all about the journey, and I could not have moved on with the reconstruction without settling this issue. Also, I'm still convinced the _Fleet Defender_ codebase will come in useful, and getting familiar with it gave me a new source of insight and inspiration.

I also fixed a bunch of serious bugs in my tooling, further enabling it to work with more than just F15SE2, and implemented useful features which will become useful again when we decide to branch out to F-19 and F-117 in the future. All of this stuff is available in [mzretools v1.0.0](https://github.com/neuviemeporte/mzretools).

Additionally, I am still not convinced my signature search is a 100% reliable. For one, I'm reusing an enum for the instruction class (mov/sub/jump/...) which is an abstract representation of the opcode, and it retains some differences between instructions that I really should make more vague, like the fact that it uselessly distinguishes between call/jmp and their far equivalents. For memory operands, it remembers if an instruction used an 8-, or a 16bit offset for a data reference, which can also introduce differences into otherwise equivalent code. There could also be some serious bugs that make it miss matches for some other reason, who knows. What I'm saying is that there still could be breakthroughs made on the tooling which would let it find more matches for `f14.exe`.

Finally, the leaked code itself introduces problems. Parts of it are disabled with `#ifdef YEP/#endif` - WTF??? Parts are commented out, with no way of telling whether they have been that way forever, or just disabled somewhere along the way. More work needs to be done to clean it up, generate more signatures and try again with different variants of the build.

With that said and done, I really should get to reconstructing `egame.exe`. I won't make any promises this time, but the day is getting close...
