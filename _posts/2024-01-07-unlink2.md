(...continued from  [Part 1]({% post_url 2023-12-30-unlink %}))

If there's anything life has taught me, it's got to be that [submitting a question](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/28248/why-does-my-mz-executables-bss-inflate-by-1-5kb-after-linking-fopen-with-msc) publicly is a surefire way of figuring out the answer myself within an hour or so... unless it actually takes a couple months.

For context, I am trying to find parts of the game's data segment which can be attributed to linking in the Microsoft C library. In the first part, I figured out initialized data as the easier task, but was left stumped with the layout of the uninitialized (BSS) data section, which contains a little over 1500 bytes of unaccounted-for data:

<pre>
dseg:0346                 db 0FFh
dseg:0347                 db 0FFh
dseg:0348                 db 0FFh ðŸŸ¢ libc initialized data ends here, BSS begins
dseg:0349                 db 407h dup(   ?)       ; what is this?
dseg:0750 word_11CD0      dw ?                    ; my program's data
dseg:0752 word_11CD2      dw ?                    ; 
dseg:0754                 db 20Ch dup(   ?)       ; what is this?
dseg:0754 dseg            ends
</pre>

I started approaching this with the idea I had at the end of the previous part - removing all the libc function references from my experiment and readding them one by one, to figure out what makes these mysterious areas appear and narrow down where they are coming from. Soon enough, I had my culprit - any of the file I/O-related functions such as `fopen`/`fread`/`fflush`/... would result in these appearing. It looks like it might be some buffer area related to file I/O? Makes a lot of sense, but what doesn't is that there were __no references__ to these areas from the libc code. I looked over the code of all libc functions in a minimal executable file reproducing this result (just the startup code and `main()` calling `fflush()`), paying special attention to immediate values which could be offsets into the BSS -- no luck. The only reference same from the startup code:

{% highlight nasm %}
seg000:0064 start           proc near
[...]
seg000:00C9                 assume es:dseg
seg000:00C9                 cld
seg000:00CA                 mov     di, 349h ; beginning of BSS area
seg000:00CD                 mov     cx, 960h ; data segment end
seg000:00D0                 sub     cx, di   ; _end - _edata = BSS size
seg000:00D2                 xor     ax, ax
seg000:00D4                 rep stosb        ; zero out the BSS
[...]
{% endhighlight %}

This code performs zeroing out of the BSS before control passes to `main()`. But there was no code using the BSS! 

I started opening the individual object files for file I/O routines extracted (using objconv) from the `slibce.lib` library like `fflush.obj`, `fopen.obj` etc. in IDA, hoping to find some BSS data inside. No such luck. Where is this crap coming from?!

Then I get an idea. I was using the `/M` switch to the linker this whole time, which creates a human readable "map file" of the linked executable. Let's look inside:

<pre>

This is surprising. I was expecting all my uninitialized data to be part of the `_BSS` segment, meanwhile it looks like the bulk (0x604 == 1540 bytes) lies in `c_common`, and the size of `_BSS` is actually zero. It takes a web search into some long [forgotten corners](https://www.pcjs.org/documents/books/mspl13/msdos/encyclopedia/section2/) of the Web to figure out what `c_common` is:

> LINK also generates default segments into which it places communal variables declared in COMDEF records.  
Near communal variables are placed in one paragraph-aligned public segment named __c_common__, with class name BSS  
(block storage space) and group DGROUP. Far communal variables are placed in a paragraph-aligned segment named FAR_BSS,  
with class name FAR_BSS.

An [another search](https://www.pcjs.org/documents/books/mspl13/masm/qaprog/) defines "communal variables":

> Communal variables are uninitialized variables that are both public and external. They are often declared in include files.  
(...)
C variables declared outside functions (except static variables) are communal unless explicitly initialized; they are the same as assembly-language communal variables.

OK, so we are looking for communal variables, but where are they? The smoking gun is hidden further in the map file, where all the public symbols are listed ("Publics by Name"). It seems like the data segment is represented by the segment prefix of `158` in the map file, so let's take a look at it while introducing some ordering:

<pre>
ninja@dell:eaglestrike$ cat build-f15-se2/HELLO.MAP | grep 158: | sort -u
 0158:0   DGROUP
 0158:0042       _foobar
 0158:0050       _barfoo
 0158:0052       _foobaz
 0158:0062       __asizds
 0158:0064       __atopsp
 0158:0066       __aexit_rtn
 0158:0068       __abrktb
 0158:00B8       __abrkp
 [...]
 0158:034A       _edata
 0158:0350       __bufout
 0158:0550       __bufin
 0158:0750       _x
 0158:0752       _y
 0158:0754       __buferr
 0158:0960       _end
</pre>

Gotcha! `_edata` is a handy tag assigned by the linker to the location where the initialized data ends, so it seems my troublemakers are named `__bufout`, `__bufin` and `__buferr` (`x` and `y` are sentinel values from my code, which I wrote in Part 1). Whare did y'all come from?

<pre>
ninja@dell:slibce$ for f in *.obj; do echo "==== $f"; dmpobj $f | grep bufout; done
[...]
==== _file.obj
    3 - '__bufout' Type 0, NEAR, Size:00000200h
==== _flsbuf.obj
    5 - '__bufout' Type:0
[...]
</pre>

Looks like these came from the object file `_file.obj`, so let's inspect it:

<pre>
ninja@dell:slibce$ dmpobj _file.obj
[...]
COMDEF(b0) recnum:13, offset:000000b0h, len:002ah, chksum:f7h(f7)
    2 - '__bufin' Type 0, NEAR, Size:00000200h
    3 - '__bufout' Type 0, NEAR, Size:00000200h
    4 - '__buferr' Type 0, NEAR, Size:00000200h
[...]
</pre>

Three buffers of size 0x200 make 0x600, i.e. 1536 bytes. Now I smell blood. But how come I couldn't find any references to these? No code is using it, and without having some reference to grab onto, I will not be able to locate their equivalent locations in the actual game executable. This time, the key lies in the other object file that references this symbol, `_flsbuf.obj`. I open it in IDA:

{% highlight nasm %}
_TEXT:0010 __flsbuf        proc near
[...]
_TEXT:00A8                 jnz     short loc_100E0
_TEXT:00AA                 mov     ax, offset __bufout
_TEXT:00AD                 jmp     short loc_100E3
_TEXT:00AF                 align 2
_TEXT:00B0 loc_100E0:
_TEXT:00B0                 mov     ax, offset __buferr
{% endhighlight %}

My minimal example does not have `__flsbuf`. But when I add all the other libc functions that the game is using, it is also pulled in by the linker. Apparently, these three buffer areas are placed in the executable by the linker *even if nothing is referencing them*! Damn, those old linkers sure acted weird. I could not find references to the problematic areas because I was looking at a minimal example which had the data, but not the code using the data, which I thought was not possible. But now I can locate `__bufout` and `__buferr` by looking at this specific location in `__flsbuf`. That still leaves `__bufin` though.

<pre>
ninja@dell:slibce$ for f in *.obj; do echo "==== $f"; dmpobj $f | grep bufin; done
[...]
==== _file.obj
    2 - '__bufin' Type 0, NEAR, Size:00000200h
</pre>

This symbol is only referenced in `_file.obj`, so let's open it in IDA again:

{% highlight nasm %}
_DATA:0000 ; FILE _iob[]
_DATA:0000 __iob           dw offset __bufin
_DATA:0002                 align 4

_DATA:0014                 db    0
_DATA:0015                 db    0
_DATA:0016                 db    2
_DATA:0017                 db    2
_DATA:0018                 db    0
_DATA:0019                 db    0
_DATA:001A                 db    0
_DATA:001B                 db    0
_DATA:001C                 db    0
_DATA:001D                 db    0
_DATA:001E                 db  84h ; you will be useful
{% endhighlight %}

By searching for the value of 0x84 in the executable's initialized data section, then going back counting the bytes, I can locate the offset containing the pointer to `__bufin`. Now it all comes together beautifully:

It was trivial to find the corresponding areas in the game's executable by examining the equivalent telltale locations. I now have all the data regions introduced by libc identified and marked in the disassembly. It may not be much, but it's always an extra piece of information and a necessary step if I ever aim for a near-perfect recreation (I'll explain why a fully perfect one is not feasible another time). If it ever comes to that, this post will have a Part 3, but I'm pretty satisfied with what I got right now.

If that's the good news, the bad news has got to be that I'm officially out of excuses to continue the reconstruction of a nasty game routine that ostensibly has to do with mission generation, consists of multiple nested loops and conditions, with an occasional `goto` sprinkled in, and nothing it does makes sense on the surface - just reading and writing of random-looking numeric data all over the place. But I'll figure it out. Some day.
